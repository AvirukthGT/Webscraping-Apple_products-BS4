ANC - really good, but can cause a pressure change in ear with some discomfort. Needs low/med/hi setting. On long road trips the ANC helps with ear fatigue due to road noise, but when driving around the city i use transparency mode for safety reasons.Transparency - excellent, can have a conversation with music on low volume in background no problem. However, when in a very quiet space you can hear the noise floor being introduced by the dsp.Adaptive transparency mode - the best feature and the future of ear protection. Prevents unsafe sounds from damaging ears. Things like dyson hand dryers and vacuums hurt my ears. I would be totally fine with wearing these to a live concert - in fact I did. While it wasn’t *perfect*, i still much prefer wearing these to ear plugs.Sound quality - excellent! The auto loudness shelf increases low and high frequencies as you reduce the volume. I happen to like listening to music at a low volume so this suits my use case. Look up Equal Loudness Contour graph or “Fletcher Munson curve” for a better understanding on what and why this meaningful.Microphone - I drive a loud 4WD and have always struggled with call quality while driving. I now use these instead and people I’m chatting to can’t even tell I’m in the car. No complaints on the microphone!Battery - no issues with the extent of battery life. When the battery is low they will have trouble connecting to your phone, but it wont be obvious that this is the problem. There is a widget that tells you the battery life but I’m not always looking at it, particularly when driving. It would be nice if there was an audible indicator on the airpod after inserting to ear which tells you when the battery is very low. (Like some other competitor earphones have)Issues - initially some crackling/popping while streaming audio, happens in transparency or anc modes, but after a firmware update this was fixed.Case scratches far too easy, recommend a case for the case. Elgato silicone are not great/collect dust. ESR cyber armor tough case is fantastic and cheap.Noise introduced from EMI with transparency mode on - have noticed this sometimes as i work in audio systems - when standing very close to equipment racks or busy electrical systems, sometimes noise is introduced through the AirPods. This doesn’t happen very often and will unlikely happen to most people.The spatial audio setting - while watching movie or TV content has a sound, almost as if you’ve placed speaker inside a pipe. However, they have achieved the phantom centre image quite well. High-frequency distortion, accompanies certain speech aspects while watching video in this mode.Conclusion - I am over the moon with these, after buying so many other ANC TWS buds, i have finally found ones that work extremely well. I can’t comment on how well they work without an iPhone, (I imagine not very well). They do have a little trouble connecting to Windows 11 laptop initially, but they do actually do a decent hand off from phone to laptop (dual connection). It’s not perfect, but ok.

Incredible Sound Quality and Comfort!
Reviewed in Australia on 10 February 2025Verified Purchase
I recently upgraded to the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation), and I am blown away by how much better they are compared to the first generation. The sound quality is phenomenal – rich bass, clear mids, and crisp highs. The noise cancellation is top-notch, blocking out background noise perfectly, which makes listening to music or taking calls a breeze, even in noisy environments.The new H2 chip is a game-changer. Not only does it improve the sound, but it also makes the overall experience smoother with better connectivity. The transparency mode is fantastic for when I need to hear the environment around me without taking the AirPods out, which is really handy in public places.The fit is also great. The multiple sizes of silicone ear tips ensure that you can find the perfect fit for your ears, providing both comfort and a secure seal for optimal sound. I’ve worn them for hours at a time with no discomfort.Battery life is impressive as well. I can get several hours of use on a single charge, and the case provides multiple additional charges, so I’m never worrying about running out of battery.Overall, the AirPods Pro (2nd Generation) are worth every penny. They deliver exceptional sound quality, effective noise cancellation, and all-day comfort. Highly recommended for anyone looking to upgrade their audio experience!

Apple excellence
Reviewed in Australia on 2 March 2025Style: USB-CVerified Purchase
I really like these headphones. I never thought that in-ear pods would fit me. Up until now, none have. These do. They feel comfortable and secure with the standard tips, but good to have other sizes if needed. I have gone cycling with these on a five hour ride and give them a push about every hour to keep them snug. The sound quality is excellent for popular music, classical music, and spoken word in podcasts, YouTube, phone calls, and online Teams meetings. The noise control options are brilliant and I love the transparency mode while exercising, to maintain awareness of my surroundings, but can block out the background noise almost completely when needed. Had to buy a second pair for my wife. Amazon price was excellent. Morning order for evening delivery!

they sound amazingly well, the noise canceling is great and the integration with other apple products is unmatched - could not recommend more. The sound and feeling in ears is soo much better than 2nd gen airpods once i got these i cant go back.

Good noise-cancelling
Reviewed in Australia on 4 November 2024Verified Purchase
These are great and have good noise-cancelling ability. They do hurt my ears sometimes and occasionally the ambient white noise becomes irritating. Most of the time these are great however and the sound quality is good for music.

A very effective device
Reviewed in Australia on 5 April 2025Style: USB-CVerified Purchase
This is an excellent product that has freed me from the clutches of Hearing Aid stores and high prices. A hearing test on the refurbished iPhone 12 (with the latest update) was a breeze. I can even hear the battery-driven clock ticking away on the wall. Of course, at my age, there is so much I no longer want to hear, but at times, the Airpods do come in handy.

Very speedy delivery
Reviewed in Australia on 6 February 2025Style: USB-CVerified Purchase
Came the same day I ordered it and I love the product. I have had Airpods in the past and the Pros noise cancellation is by far my favourite feature when I'm at work and have noisy neighbours. I also have a Mac and iPhone to the automatic change between devices is very useful when listening to music on my phone and then playing a video on my Mac. The earphone comfort could be a little better as I wear them the whole workday and my ears do get sore by the end. Also wish the battery was a bit longer but a quick charge at lunch does make them last the day.
